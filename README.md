# subreddit-fetcher

A script that fetches new posts from any subreddit. A post's data is uploaded to ezpaste.ezluci.com and will be sent to any Discord channels you wish via webhooks.

To use it, you need to update the config in index.mjs, run `npm install axios` and then run `node index.mjs` to start the script.
